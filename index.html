    <div class="About-me">
      <p>As the title suggests, I'm Robert Hickman. Back on July 21st, 1994, I was born in Fort Worth, Texas. My mother raised my two sisters and me by herself. During my childhood, my family moved all around the country. Below is a list of all the places I lived in chronological order.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Fort Worth,Texas</li>
          <li>Aurora, Colorado</li>
          <li>Justin, Texas</li>
          <li>Denton, Texas</li>
          <li>Mountain view, Arkansas</li>
          <li>Hendersonville, North Carolina</li>
          <li>St.Augustine, Florida</li>
          <li>Denver, Colorado</li>
          <li>Taos, New Mexico</li>
          <li>Portland, Oregon</li>
        </ol>

      <p>After all of that moving, we've been settled in Portland for the last 11 years. I finished highschool at Reynolds Highschool in Troutdale. After I graduated, I worked for Arby's and Taco bell while going to Mt.Hood Community College. I earned an Associates in General Studies. I eventually got a Job as a dispatcher for RideConnection for a couple of years. I left to work for the Portland Water Bureau as a water meter reader and I'm currently still working there. Epicodus is my first experience with coding. My friend <em>Ellie</em> is a software engineer and perked my interest in the field. </p>
      <p>While I work and go to school, I still manage to continue my life long hobbies. Below is a short list of what I like doing.</p>
    
        <ul>
          <li>Biking</li>
          <li>Hiking</li>
          <li>Playing videogames. Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWchHi9BCKwrNOPPR-vnBEA?view_as=subscriber">link</a> to my youtube channel, if you are interested in gaming videos</li>
          <li>Woodworking</li>
          <li>Dancing</li>
        </ul>

      <p>I hope you now have an idea about who I am</p>

      <p>So far at Epicodus, I have explored Git, Html, and CSS. The different projects I completed helped solidify the concepts that we learned. Below are just some of the projects that we have created.
         <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.github.com/RobHickman/My-first-webpage">My-first-webpage</a> is a project that I created to practice inline and block elements. The project contains a css, two htmls, a readme, and an img file.</li>
